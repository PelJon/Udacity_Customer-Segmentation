### Project Overview

The Capstone Project is the final submission for Udacitys Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program. The selected project is based on a real-life example of Arvato, an internationally active services company with a focus on innovations in automation and data/analytics. The requested analysis in about the provided customer data set of a German mail-order sales company to identify customer cluster which can be used to predict the success of targeted marketing campaigns.

The clustering of customers and a respective personalization is a must-have in today's business world. A recent RedPoint Global survey<sup>1</sup> conducted by The Harris Poll that surveyed more than 3,000 consumers in the U.S., U.K., and Canada stated, that

> 63 percent, of consumers expect personalization as a standard of service and believe they are recognized as an individual when sent special offers

It clearly shows that companies need to take into account the characteristics of a customer when choosing the channel, message, and method in a marketing campaign. Multiple studies show, that personalization has a huge impact on the success of a marketing campaign. A study in 2013 by Experian Marketing Services<sup>2</sup> shows that
 
 > personalized promotional emails were shown to lift transaction rates and revenue per email six times higher than non-personalized emails.
 
The relevance in today's business world, as well as the variety of different machine learning methods to be used in this exercise, excites me the most. it gives the possibility to try different methods and explore different libraries and methods while having a clear goal in mind.

The request is split into three main objectives. First, get an overall understanding of the provided customer and German population database to derive an understanding of the data and clean/transform it in a way that it can be used for the following machine learning exercises. 

Secondly, the cleaned data should be used to derive the population cluster which is mapped to the customer database to identify and analyze the relationships between the demographics of the company's existing customers and the general population of Germany. The goal of the second part of the analysis is to describe the parts of the general population that are more likely to be part of the mail-order company's main customer base, and which parts of the general population are less so.

Lastly, the provided understanding should be the basis to train a classification/prediction model based on an existing mailout campaign. In the end, we should be able to use the demographic information from each individual to decide whether or not it will be worth it to include that person in the campaign to and predict the likelihood of response for future mailout campaigns.

The analysis is based on four main datasets, which are all provided by Arvato. The first is a dataset of 891.211 persons (rows) and 366 features (columns) on demographics data for the general population of Germany. It will be used to define a general descriptive cluster for a later mapping of the mail-order company customer base. The customer database consists of  191 652 persons (rows) and 369 features (columns) with demographics data for customers of a mail-order company. It will be used to identify which cluster is in the current customer base of the mail-order company. For classification/prediction model are a train (42 982 persons (rows) with 367 (columns)) and a test dataset (42 982 persons (rows) x 366 (columns)) provided. The train has an additional "RESPONSE" column and will be used to train the classification model for the prediction of success of future targeted marketing campaigns. The test model is without the "RESPONSE" column and can be used in a KAGGLE competition for the success of future targeted marketing campaigns.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement can be split into the main two tasks of the analysis: **Population/Customer Segmentation** and **Classification/Prediction**

#### Population/Customer Segmentation

The key problem to solve is to prepare and cluster the population data in a way, that we can define a clear cluster of interest for the mail-order company, once the customer base is mapped to the trained classificator. Therefore, the key objective is first to transform the dataset, to remove the noise, and to define the major differentiator. 

The data transformation will be done in multiple steps. First, we get an overview of the available German population and customer base dataset (columns, data types, shape, unique, distribution, and percentage of the missing values per column). Once, we have a good understanding of the provided dataset, we start to identify missing values and replace them accordingly. Columns/rows, with a high percentage of missing data, will be removed from the dataset, as they don't provide clear differentiators for the later segmentation. Next, we encode the categorical values to be able to further work with them in the segmentation and transformation process.

After a data normalization step, the simplified German population dataset will be used for a PCA (principal component analysis), as it is a fast and flexible unsupervised method for dimensionality reduction in data. It involves zeroing out one or more of the smallest principal components, resulting in a lower-dimensional projection of the data that preserves the maximal data variance<sup>3</sup>.

> Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance.<sup>3</sup>

Once we reduced the noise and dimensions of the segmentation, we will train and optimize a **KMeans cluster algorithm** to detect customer segmentations.

> The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to a large number of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields<sup>4</sup>.

The K-means algorithm aims to choose centroids that minimise the inertia, or within-cluster sum-of-squares criterion:

The trained cluster model will be used on the customer dataset (which is transformed in the same way as the general population database) to compare the percentages of people per cluster in both datasets. The trained cluster model will show the population cluster, which has a higher/lower percentage as the general Population representation and, therefore, more probably more likely to respond to future marketing/sales campaigns.

#### Classification/Prediction


In this section, you will want to clearly define the problem that you are trying to solve, including the strategy (outline of tasks) you will use to achieve the desired solution. You should also thoroughly discuss what the intended solution will be for this problem. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?_
- _Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?_
- _Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?_

### Metrics
In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the metrics youâ€™ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?_
- _Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?_


## II. Analysis
_(approx. 2-4 pages)_

### Data Exploration
In this section, you will be expected to analyze the data you are using for the problem. This data can either be in the form of a dataset (or datasets), input data (or input files), or even an environment. The type of data should be thoroughly described and, if possible, have basic statistics and information presented (such as discussion of input features or defining characteristics about the input or environment). Any abnormalities or interesting qualities about the data that may need to be addressed have been identified (such as features that need to be transformed or the possibility of outliers). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that summarizes or extracts a relevant characteristic or feature about the data. The visualization should adequately support the data being used. Discuss why this visualization was chosen and how it is relevant. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques
In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark
In this section, you will need to provide a clearly defined benchmark result or threshold for comparing across performances obtained by your solution. The reasoning behind the benchmark (in the case where it is not an established result) should be discussed. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing
In this section, all of your preprocessing steps will need to be clearly documented, if any were necessary. From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the modelâ€™s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your modelâ€™s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
